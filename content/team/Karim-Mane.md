- MSc Bioinformatics, [Cheikh Anta Diop University of Dakar in Senegal](https://www.ucad.sn/)
- Bioinformatician, [Wellcome - MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute](https://www.stemcells.cam.ac.uk/)

Karim obtained his MSCs in Bioinformatics in 2016 from the Cheikh Anta Diop University of Dakar in Senegal. 
He joined the Statistics and Bioinformatics department of the Medical Research Council of The Gambia (MRCG), 
now part of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), in 2017. At MRCG@LSHTM, he worked 
within a malaria research group analysing Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. Karim has handled large 
genetic datasets of different markers such as Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), microsatellites and 
RNA-Seq data. He also provided support across the virology and disease control themes, specifically writing, 
maintaining and editing analysis pipelines. Karim also mentored 4 students during his time at MRCG@LSHTM. 
Since April 2021, he moved to the UK and joined Nangalia's group at the Wellcome MRC Cambridge Stem Cell 
Institute, focused on studying the origin and evolution of blood cancer. His role involves analysis of whole 
genome methylation data from normal and MPN patients, and the development of tools to analyse and simulate 
whole genome sequencing blood cancer data.
