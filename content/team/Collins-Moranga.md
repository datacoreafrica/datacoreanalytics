- PhD Bioinformatics, [West African Centre for Cell Biology of Infectious Pathogens, Legon](https://www.waccbip.org/)

Collins M. Morang’a has extensive expertise in Bioinformatics and a keen interest in Data Science. 
Currently, he is a bioinformatician at the WACCBIP involved in tracking SARS-CoV-2 evolution in 
West Africa to guide public health interventions. His previous research involved statistical 
analysis of basic science and public health interventions datasets. His PhD research focused on 
developing machine learning algorithms towards creating efficient clinical decision support tools 
that can diagnose malaria. Also, during his PhD, he used single-cell RNA technologies to understand 
the cellular level host transcriptomic differences between different malaria outcomes. He has earned 
three travel awards during his career, one best poster presentation, one best oral presenter, and 
a PhD research fellowship in the prestigious Africa DELTAS scheme. Since 2017, he has authored two and 
co-authored eight scientific articles that range from policy-driven to biomedical research publications. 
Collins has a passion for empowering, mentoring, and accelerating excellence in young African 
bioinformaticians and data scientists through training and capacity development.
